# Team MAKER (Work in Progress)
## Ever wanted to play gully cricket with friends but instead of playing most time is wasted in deciding the teams, arguing who will be on what team who will be the captain?<br /><br /> Well, we have a solution for you.<br /><br /> We present to you our project "Team Maker" which will help you to make teams in a fair and unbiased way.<br /><br />Just enter the names of the players and the number of teams you want to make and let the program do the rest.<br /><br />The program will randomly assign the players to the teams and also select a captain for each team.<br /><br />So, what are you waiting for? Go ahead and make your teams with Team Maker.
# Happy Playing!
